# PokemonAR
First Augmented Reality Game

# Inspiration
After watching Black Mirror's Season 3 Episode 2, "Playtest", in which Cooper (the episode's protagonist) demos an unreleased machine learning, horror, mixed reality game. I was amazed by the mixed reality aspect of the game and how virtual reality and actual reality interact with each other. After the episode I was like "brooooooooo I wanna work on a project like this". Basically if you know me, my childhood was made by playing Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow on my Red Gameboy Color, so from that I wanted to recreate a Augmented Reality game where Pokemons battle each other using Pokemon Cards to bring the Pokemons to "real life".
