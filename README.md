## About
PokemonAR is a short turn-based game of Snorlax vs. Armored Mewtwo.

## Vuforia
I used Vuforia to connect the Pokemon Cards as the Image Targets to augment Snorlax and Mewtwo's 3D models.

- There are 4 buttons, Snorlax's moveset, that you can use.

## Gameplay
- Coming Soon.

### Future Updates
- I plan to switch out the buttons with speech recognition to use moves instead.
- I wasn't able to incorporate speech recognition because I wasn't able to update Windows 10. I tried though. But my laptop got infinitely "stuck" and I had to factory reset my laptop, and I lost a lot of my files. So I'm lowkey traumatized and will try again later. :(
